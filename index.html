                Java is the high-level, object-oriented, robust, secure programming language, platform-independent, high performance, Multithreaded, and portable programming language. It was developed by James Gosling in June 1991. It can also be
                 known as the platform as it provides its own JRE and API.

                <b>JVM</b>
              <p>
                JVM is an acronym for Java Virtual Machine; it is an abstract machine which provides the runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It is a specification which specifies the working of Java Virtual Machine. Its implementation has been provided by Oracle 
                and other companies. Its implementation is known as JRE.
              </p>
              <b>JRE</b>
              <p>
                JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment. It is the implementation of JVM. The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. It physically exists.
                 It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.
              </p>
              <b>JDK</b>
              <p>
                JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. 
                It is a software development environment which is used to develop Java
                 applications and applets. It physically exists.
                  It contains JRE + development tools.

                Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler: It is used to improve the performance. JIT compiles parts of the bytecode that have similar functionality at the same time, and hence reduces the amount of time needed for compilation. Here the term “compiler” refers to a translator from the instruction set of a Java virtual machine 
                (JVM) to the instruction set of a specific CPU.
